# Minimal raddbg integration for 10x editor. 
Presented as is

Inspired by ["RemedyBG debugger integration for 10x (10xeditor.com)"](https://github.com/slynch8/10x/blob/main/PythonScripts/RemedyBG/RemedyBG.py) by septag@pm.me

Place in your 10x\PythonScripts folder to run

Does not tightly integrate raddbg to 10x (10x doesn't know when breakpoints are hit), but supports commands like launch debugger, stop debugger, updating breakpoints, etc
